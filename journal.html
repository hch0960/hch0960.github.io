        <br> Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
        <ol>
            <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
            <li>Magic City, ID</li>
            <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
            <li> Last Chance, CO</li>
            <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
            <li> Why, AZ</li>
        </ol>

        <br> I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
        <blockquote>"Passing cars,
            <br> When you can't see, May get you, A glimpse, Of eternity."
        </blockquote> I definitely won't be passing any cars.

        <br> My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
        <ul>
            <li>cellphone,</li>
            <li> iPod,</li>
            <li> digital camera,</li>
            <li> protein bar</li>
        </ul>Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said,
        <blockquote> "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
        </blockquote>
